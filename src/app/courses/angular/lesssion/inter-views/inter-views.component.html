        <h1>1. What is Angular Framework?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Angular is a popular open-source framework developed and maintained by Google. It's used for building
            client-side web applications and single-page applications (SPAs). Angular provides a comprehensive solution
            for structuring and building dynamic web applications using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.</p>
        <b>Key features of Angular include:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Component-Based Architecture:</b> Angular applications are built using components. Each component
                encapsulates a part of the user interface and its behavior, making it easier to manage and reuse code.
            </li>
            <li><b>Templates:</b> Angular uses HTML templates with additional syntax and features, such as data binding,
                to define the UI of an application. Templates allow developers to create dynamic and responsive user
                interfaces.</li>
            <li><b>Dependency Injection:</b> Angular's dependency injection system helps manage the dependencies of
                components, services, and other objects within an application. It promotes modularity and makes it
                easier to test and maintain code.</li>
            <li><b>Routing:</b> Angular provides a powerful routing mechanism for building SPAs with multiple views.
                Developers can define routes and navigation paths, allowing users to navigate between different parts of
                the application without full-page reloads.</li>
            <li><b>Services:</b> Services are a way to encapsulate reusable functionality that can be shared across
                components. Angular's dependency injection system makes it easy to inject services into components and
                other parts of the application.</li>
            <li><b>Directives:</b> Angular directives allow developers to extend HTML with custom behavior and
                attributes. Directives can be used to manipulate the DOM, add interactivity, and create reusable UI
                components.</li>
            <li><b>Forms:</b> Angular provides robust support for building forms, including template-driven forms and
                reactive forms. This makes it easy to create complex forms with validation and data binding.</li>
            <li><b>HTTP Client:</b> Angular includes an HTTP client module for making HTTP requests to backend servers.
                It provides features such as request and response handling, error handling, and support for observables.
            </li>
            <li><b>Cross-Platform:</b> Angular supports building web applications as well as native mobile applications
                using frameworks like Ionic or NativeScript.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="questions" id="What_are_directives">
        <h1>3. What are directives?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Directives in Angular are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment, or CSS
            class) that tell Angular's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element or
            transform the DOM element and its children.</p>
        <b>There are three types of directives in Angular:</b>
        <h3><b>i. Component Directives:</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Components are directives with a template. They are the most common type of directive used in Angular
                applications.</li>
            <li>Components encapsulate the template, styles, and behavior into a reusable building block.</li>
            <li>Components are used to create custom elements in the DOM, encapsulating their behavior and presentation
                logic.</li>
            <b>Example:</b>
            <prismcode [code]="code" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            <b>Usage in HTML:</b>
            <prismcode [code]="code1" language="html"></prismcode>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>ii. Structural Directives:</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Structural directives change the structure of the DOM by adding, removing, or manipulating elements.
            </li>
            <li>They are applied as attributes on HTML elements, prefixed with an asterisk (*).</li>
            <li>Structural directives typically alter the layout of the DOM by adding or removing elements based on
                conditions.</li>
            <b>*ngIf:</b>
            <prismcode [code]="code2" language="html"></prismcode>
            <b>*ngFor:</b>
            <prismcode [code]="code3" language="html"></prismcode>
            <b>ngSwitch:</b>
            <prismcode [code]="code4" language="html"></prismcode>
            <b>ngTemplateOutlet:</b>
            <prismcode [code]="code5" language="html"></prismcode>
            <b>ngContainer:</b>
            <prismcode [code]="code6" language="html"></prismcode>
            <b>Creating Custom Structural Directive:</b>
            <p>First create app.customdirective.ts file:</p>
            <prismcode [code]="code7" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            <p>add it to AppModule:</p>
            <prismcode [code]="code8" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            <p>use it in your components:</p>
            <prismcode [code]="code9" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>iii. Attribute Directives:</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Attribute directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.
            </li>
            <li>They are applied as attributes on HTML elements.</li>
            <li>Attribute directives can modify the behavior, appearance, or attributes of elements they are applied to.
            </li>
            <b>ngClass:</b>
            <prismcode [code]="code10" language="html"></prismcode>

        <h1>4. What are components?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>In Angular, components are the building blocks of the user interface. They are reusable, self-contained units
            that encapsulate the template, styles, and behavior of a part of the application's UI.</p>
        <p>Here's a simple example of an Angular component:</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code16" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>In this example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>@Component</b> is the decorator that provides metadata about the component.</li>
            <li><b>selector</b> specifies how the component is identified within the HTML markup.</li>
            <li><b>templateUrl</b> points to the external HTML file containing the component's template.</li>
            <li><b>styleUrls</b> specifies the external CSS file(s) for styling.</li>
            <li><b>ExampleComponent</b> is the class that defines the component's behavior, including properties and

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_a_data_binding">
        <h1>8. What is a data binding?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Data binding in Angular refers to the automatic synchronization of data between the model (component class
            properties) and the view (HTML template). It allows you to eliminate the manual manipulation of the DOM,
            making your code more concise and maintainable.</p>
        <p><b>There are mainly four ways to do data binding in Angular:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Interpolation (&lbrace;&lbrace;&rbrace;<span>&rbrace;</span>)</li>
            <li>Property Binding ([ ])</li>
            <li>Event Binding (( ))</li>
            <li>Two-way Binding ([(ngModel)])</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Here's a brief explanation and example of each:</p>
        <p><b>Interpolation (&lbrace;&lbrace;&rbrace;<span>&rbrace;</span>):</b>It allows you to bind a component
            property to an HTML element by wrapping it in double curly braces. Angular evaluates the expression and
            inserts the result into the HTML.</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code18" language="html"></prismcode>
        <p><b>Property Binding ([ ]):</b>It binds a component property to an HTML element property. The value of the
            component property is set to the value of the HTML element property.</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code19" language="html"></prismcode>
        <p><b>Event Binding (( )):</b>It binds an HTML event to a method in the component class. When the event occurs,
            the associated method is executed.</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code20" language="html"></prismcode>
        <p><b>Two-way Binding ([(ngModel)]):</b>It combines property binding and event binding to achieve two-way data
            binding. It binds a component property to an input element property and listens for changes to update the
            component property accordingly.</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code21" language="html"></prismcode>
        <p>Same other ways to do Binding in Angular:</p>
        <p><b>Attribute Binding:</b>Similar to property binding, but it binds to an element attribute instead of a
            property. It's often used when dealing with non-standard attributes or when you need to bind to an attribute
            that doesn't have a corresponding property.</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code22" language="html"></prismcode>
        <p><b>Class Binding:</b> It allows you to conditionally apply CSS classes to HTML elements based on component
            properties.</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code23" language="html"></prismcode>
        <p><b>Style Binding:</b>Similar to class binding, but it allows you to conditionally apply inline styles to HTML
            elements based on component properties.</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code24" language="html"></prismcode>
        <p><b>Template Reference Variables:</b>They allow you to get a reference to an HTML element or Angular component
            in the template and use it in the component class.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_the_pipe">
        <h1>11. What is the pipe?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>In Angular, pipes are a feature that allows you to transform data in your templates before displaying it.
            Pipes can be used to format data, filter data, or perform other transformations. Angular provides several
            built-in pipes, and you can also create custom pipes to suit your specific needs.</p>
        <p>Here are the main types of pipes in Angular, along with explanations and examples for each:</p>
        <p><b>1. Built-in Pipes:</b>DatePipe/UpperCasePipe/LowerCasePipe/CurrencyPipe/DecimalPipe</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code31" language="html"></prismcode>
        <p><b>2. Custom Pipes:</b></p>
        <p>a.<b>Pure Pipes: </b>Pure pipes are stateless pipes that are re-evaluated only when the input data changes.
            They take input data, transform it, and return the transformed result. Pure pipes are generally preferred
            for most use cases because they offer better performance by reducing unnecessary recalculations.Example:</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code32" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>b.<b>Impure Pipes: </b>Impure pipes can have internal state and can perform additional actions. They are
            re-evaluated on every change detection cycle, regardless of whether the input data has changed or not.
            Impure pipes should be used sparingly, as they can potentially degrade the performance of your application
            by causing unnecessary recalculations.Example:</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code33" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>Some Other important Pipes:</p>
        <p>i. <b>Chained Pipe:</b>Chained pipes refer to the practice of chaining multiple pipes together in a single
            expression within your template. This allows you to apply multiple transformations to a value
            sequentially.Example</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code34" language="html"></prismcode>
        <p>ii. <b>Parametrized Pipe:</b>Parametrized pipes are pipes that accept parameters to customize their behavior.
            Parameters are passed to pipes within the template using colon-separated values.Example</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code35" language="html"></prismcode>
        <p>iii. <b>AsyncPipe:</b>The AsyncPipe is a built-in pipe in Angular that is used for handling asynchronous data
            streams. It subscribes to an Observable or Promise and automatically unsubscribes when the component is
            destroyed. It then emits the latest value emitted by the Observable or the resolved value of the
            Promise.Example with Observable</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code36" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>In this example, data$ is an Observable emitting a string value, and the AsyncPipe is used in the template to
            subscribe to this Observable and display its latest value.Example with Promise:</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code37" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>Here, data$ is a Promise that resolves to a string value after a delay of 2 seconds. The AsyncPipe is used to
            subscribe to this Promise and display its resolved value.</p>
        <p>The AsyncPipe is a powerful tool for handling asynchronous data in Angular applications, making it easier to
            work with Observables and Promises in templates without manually managing subscriptions and clean-ups.</p>

        <h1>12. What happens if you use script tag inside template?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it, which removes the script tag but keeps
            safe content such as the text content of the script tag. This way it eliminates the risk of script injection
            attacks. If you still use it then it will be ignored and a warning appears in the browser console.</p>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>Every application has at least one Angular module, the root module that you bootstrap to launch the

        <h1>14. What are observables?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Observables are declarative which provide support for passing messages between publishers and subscribers in
            your application. They are mainly used for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple
            values. In this case, you define a function for publishing values, but it is not executed until a consumer
            subscribes to it. The subscribed consumer then receives notifications until the function completes, or until
            they unsubscribe.</p>

        <p>Most of the Front-end applications communicate with backend services over HTTP protocol using either
            XMLHttpRequest interface or the fetch() API. Angular provides a simplified client HTTP API known as

    <div class="questions" id="What_are_dynamic_components">
        <h1>19. What are dynamic components?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Dynamic components in Angular are components that are created at runtime based on certain conditions or data.
            They offer flexibility in building dynamic user interfaces where the structure and behavior of components
            can change dynamically.</p>
        <p>Here's a step-by-step process to create and use dynamic components in Angular:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Create Dynamic Component</b>
                <p>First, you need to create the dynamic component itself. This involves creating a component class and
                    its associated template.</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code47" language="javascript"></prismcode>
                <p>This command generates a new component called DynamicComponent along with its HTML template and
                    styles.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Dynamic Component Loader</b>
                <p>Next, you need a mechanism to dynamically load and render this component in your application. Angular
                    provides a built-in directive called ngComponentOutlet for this purpose. </p>
                <prismcode [code]="code48" language="html"></prismcode>
                <p>Here, dynamicComponent is a property in your parent component that holds a reference to the
                    dynamically created component.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Dynamic Component Creation</b>
                <p>Now, you need to dynamically create an instance of the dynamic component in your parent component.
                </p>
                <prismcode [code]="code49" language="javascript"></prismcode>
                <p>In this example, createDynamicComponent() is a method that dynamically creates an instance of the
                    DynamicComponent using the ComponentFactoryResolver.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Using the Dynamic Component</b>
                <p>Finally, you can trigger the creation of the dynamic component based on certain events or conditions
                    in your application.</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code50" language="html"></prismcode>
                <p>In this example, clicking the button triggers the creation of the dynamic component, and it gets
                    rendered within the &lt;div&gt; element with the dynamicComponentContainer reference.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_are_the_advantages_with_AOT">
        <h1>34. What are the advantages with AOT?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation in Angular offers several advantages over Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Faster Startup Time: </b>AOT compilation reduces the initial loading time of an Angular application
                by pre-compiling templates and components during the build process. This results in faster startup times
                for users since there is no need for compilation in the browser at runtime.</li>
            <li><b>Smaller Bundle Size: </b>AOT compilation eliminates the need for the Angular compiler in the final
                bundle, resulting in smaller bundle sizes. This reduces the amount of code that needs to be downloaded
                by the client, leading to faster page loads and improved performance.</li>
            <li><b>Template Error Detection: </b>AOT compilation detects template errors during the build process rather
                than at runtime. This allows developers to catch errors early in the development cycle and ensures that
                applications are more robust and reliable.</li>
            <li><b>Optimized Performance: </b>AOT-compiled code tends to perform better than JIT-compiled code since it
                is optimized for production environments. This optimization includes tree-shaking, dead code
                elimination, and other performance optimizations that can lead to improved runtime performance.</li>
            <li><b>Enhanced Security: </b>AOT compilation reduces the risk of injection attacks by pre-compiling
                templates and components. Since there is no dynamic compilation in the browser, there are fewer
                opportunities for malicious code injection, leading to improved security for Angular applications.</li>
            <li><b>Improved SEO: </b>AOT compilation can improve search engine optimization (SEO) for Angular
                applications. Since the initial HTML content is pre-rendered during the build process, search engine
                crawlers can index the content more easily, leading to better search engine rankings and visibility.
            </li>
            <li><b>Better Compatibility: </b>AOT-compiled code is more compatible with certain environments, such as
                server-side rendering (SSR) and progressive web applications (PWAs). This compatibility allows Angular
                applications to run more smoothly in various deployment scenarios.</li>

        <h1>35. What are the three phases of AOT?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The AOT compiler works in three phases,</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Code Analysis:</b>The compiler records a representation of the source.</li>
            <li><b>Code generation:</b>It handles the interpretation as well as places restrictions on what it
                interprets.</li>
            <li><b>Validation:</b>In this phase, the Angular template compiler uses the TypeScript compiler to validate
                the binding expressions in templates.</li>

    <div class="questions" id="Can_I_use_arrow_functions_in_AOT">
        <h1>36. Can I use arrow functions in AOT?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>No, Arrow functions or lambda functions can’t be used to assign values to the decorator properties. For
            example, the following snippet is invalid:</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code58" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>To fix this, it has to be changed as following exported function:</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code59" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>If you still use arrow function, it generates an error node in place of the function. When the compiler later
            interprets this node, it reports an error to turn the arrow function into an exported function. Note: From
            Angular5 onwards, the compiler automatically performs this rewriting while emitting the .js file.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_the_purpose_of_metadata_json_files">
        <h1>37. What is the purpose of metadata json files?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The metadata.json file can be treated as a diagram of the overall structure of a decorator's metadata,
            represented as an abstract syntax tree(AST). During the analysis phase, the AOT collector scan the metadata
            recorded in the Angular decorators and outputs metadata information in .metadata.json files, one per .d.ts
            file.</p>

        <h1>38. Can I use any javascript feature for expression syntax in AOT?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>No, the AOT collector understands a subset of (or limited) JavaScript features. If an expression uses
            unsupported syntax, the collector writes an error node to the .metadata.json file. Later point of time, the
            compiler reports an error if it needs that piece of metadata to generate the application code.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_folding">
        <h1>39. What is folding?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The compiler can only resolve references to exported symbols in the metadata. Where as some of the
            non-exported members are folded while generating the code. i.e Folding is a process in which the collector
            evaluate an expression during collection and record the result in the .metadata.json instead of the original
            expression. For example, the compiler couldn't refer selector reference because it is not exported</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code60" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>Will be folded into inline selector</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code61" language="javascript"></prismcode>

            using new keywords and function calls.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_are_macros">
        <h1>40. What are macros?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The AOT compiler supports macros in the form of functions or static methods that return an expression in a
            single return expression. For example, let us take a below macro function,</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code62" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>You can use it inside metadata as an expression,</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code63" language="javascript"></prismcode>

                <p>Some of the language features outside of the compiler's restricted expression syntax used in angular

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Reference to a local (non-exported) symbol:</b>
                <p>The compiler encountered a referenced to a locally defined symbol that either wasn't exported or
                    wasn't initialized. Let's take example of this error,</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code66" language="javascript"></prismcode>
                <p>You can fix this by either exporting or initializing the value,</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Function calls are not supported:</b>
                <p>The compiler does not currently support function expressions or lambda functions. For example, you
                    cannot set a provider's useFactory to an anonymous function or arrow function as below.</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code68" language="javascript"></prismcode>
                <p>You can fix this with exported function</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_View_Engine_in_Angular">
        <h1>63. What is View Engine in Angular?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The View Engine was the original rendering and compilation pipeline in Angular. It was responsible for
            transforming Angular components, templates, and metadata into JavaScript code that could be executed by the
            browser. The View Engine operated by traversing the component tree and generating instructions to create and
            update the DOM elements based on the component templates.</p>
        <p>While the View Engine served its purpose, it had certain limitations and drawbacks, including:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Bundle Size:</b>The View Engine generated relatively large bundles, especially for applications with
                many components and templates.</li>
            <li><b>Performance:</b> The View Engine's runtime performance could sometimes be suboptimal, especially for
                complex applications with deep component trees.</li>
            <li><b>Debugging:</b>Debugging Angular applications compiled with the View Engine could be challenging due
                to the generated code's complexity.</li>
            <li><b>Limited Optimization:</b>The View Engine had limited support for advanced optimization techniques
                like tree-shaking and dead code elimination.</li>
        </ol>

    <div class="questions" id="What_was_improved_in_Ivy">
        <h1>64. What was improved in Ivy?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Following are significant changes and improvements were introduced with Ivy:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Improved Performance:</b>Ivy brings significant improvements in rendering and runtime performance
                compared to the View Engine. It achieves this by optimizing the generated code, reducing runtime
                overhead, and enabling more efficient change detection mechanisms.</li>
            <li><b>Faster Rebuild Times:</b>Ivy reduces rebuild times during development, making the development process
                more efficient. It achieves this by leveraging incremental compilation and smarter caching mechanisms,
                resulting in faster iterations and shorter feedback loops.</li>
            <li><b>Smaller Bundle Sizes:</b>Ivy generates smaller bundle sizes compared to the View Engine. It achieves
                this through better tree-shaking, dead code elimination, and improved optimization techniques. Smaller
                bundle sizes lead to faster load times and improved overall performance for Angular applications.</li>
            <li><b>Enhanced Debugging:</b>Ivy provides improved debugging capabilities compared to the View Engine. It
                generates more readable and understandable error messages and stack traces, making it easier for
                developers to identify and troubleshoot issues during development.</li>
            <li><b>Template Type Checking:</b>Ivy introduces template type checking, which allows for early detection of
                template-related errors at build time. This helps prevent runtime errors and improves the overall
                reliability and robustness of Angular applications.</li>
            <li><b>Smoother Developer Experience:</b>Overall, Ivy enhances the developer experience by providing faster
                rebuild times, smaller bundle sizes, improved performance, and better debugging capabilities. These
                improvements make it easier and more enjoyable to develop Angular applications.</li>

    <div class="questions" id="what_was_ways_of_make_build_of_app_Before_and_After_of_Ivy">
        <h1>65. What was ways of make build of app Before and After of Ivy?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p><b>Before Ivy:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Local Development</b>Before Ivy, for local development, developers typically used ng serve command to
                run the Angular application in development mode. This command would start a development server and
                compile the application using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. It provided features such as hot module
                replacement (HMR) for faster development iterations.</li>
            <li><b>Production Build</b>For production deployment, developers used ng build --prod command to build the
                Angular application for production. This command would compile the application using Ahead-of-Time (AOT)
                compilation to optimize performance, reduce bundle size, and enhance security.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>After Ivy:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Local Development</b>With Ivy, the process for local development remains the same. Developers still
                use ng serve command to run the Angular application in development mode. The main difference is that Ivy
                provides improved performance and faster rebuild times compared to the View Engine.</li>
            <li><b>Production Build</b>Similarly, for production deployment, developers still use ng build --prod
                command to build the Angular application for production. Ivy continues to support Ahead-of-Time (AOT)
                compilation, and the command remains unchanged. However, Ivy offers additional optimizations and
                improvements over the View Engine, resulting in even smaller bundle sizes and faster builds.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>CLI Commands:</b></p>
        <p><b>Before Ivy:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Local Development</b>ng serve</li>
            <li><b>Production Build</b>ng build --prod</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>After Ivy:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Local Development</b>ng serve</li>
            <li><b>Production Build</b>ng build --prod</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The CLI commands for local development and production builds remain the same before and after Ivy, but Ivy
            brings improvements in performance, rebuild times, and bundle sizes to both development and production
            environments.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Bazel is a powerful build tool developed and massively used by Google and it can keep track of the
            dependencies between different packages and build targets. In Angular8, you can build your CLI application
            with Bazel. Note: The Angular framework itself is built with Bazel.</p>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>Sometimes you may want to bypass the Angular CLI builder and run Bazel directly using Bazel CLI. You can
            install it globally using @bazel/bazel npm package. i.e, Bazel CLI is available under @bazel/bazel package.
            After you can apply the below common commands,</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_platform_in_Angular">
        <h1>83. What is platform in Angular?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>A platform is the context in which an Angular application runs. The most common platform for Angular
            applications is a web browser, but it can also be an operating system for a mobile device, or a web server.
            The runtime-platform is provided by the @angular/platform-* packages and these packages allow applications
            that make use of @angular/core and @angular/common to execute in different environments. i.e, Angular can be
            used as platform-independent framework in different environments, For example,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>While running in the browser, it uses platform-browser package.</li>
            <li>When SSR(server-side rendering ) is used, it uses platform-server package for providing web server
                implementation.</li>

        <h1>84. What happens if I import the same module twice?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>If multiple modules imports the same module then angular evaluates it only once (When it encounters the
            module first time). It follows this condition even the module appears at any level in a hierarchy of
            imported NgModules.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="what_is_tree_shaking">
        <h1>85. What is tree shaking?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Tree shaking is a term used in the context of JavaScript module bundling, particularly with tools like
            Webpack or Rollup. It refers to the process of eliminating dead code or unused code from your application
            bundle to make it smaller and more efficient.</p>
        <p>The term "tree shaking" comes from the idea of "shaking" a tree to remove dead branches or leaves, leaving
            behind only the parts that are needed.</p>
        <p>Here's how tree shaking typically works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Module Dependencies:</b>
                <p>When you use modern JavaScript module systems like ES6 modules, you can import functions, classes, or
                    variables from other modules into your codebase.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Unused Code Detection:</b>
                <p>During the build process, tools like Webpack or Rollup analyze your code and its dependencies to
                    identify which parts of the code are actually being used and which parts are not.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Removal of Unused Code:</b>
                <p>Once the unused code is identified, the tree shaking process removes it from the final bundle. This
                    includes functions, classes, or variables that are not referenced anywhere in your code or are not
                    part of the code executed during runtime.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Smaller Bundle Size:</b>
                <p>By removing dead code, tree shaking reduces the size of your application bundle. This results in
                    faster load times for your web application, especially on networks with limited bandwidth or slower
                    connections.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Tree shaking is particularly beneficial in modern web development where application performance and load
            times are critical. It allows developers to write code without worrying too much about the size of the final
            bundle, as unused code will be automatically removed during the build process.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="Is_Angular_supports_dynamic_imports">
        <h1>89. Is Angular supports dynamic imports?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Yes, Angular 8 supports dynamic imports in router configuration. i.e, You can use the import statement for
            lazy loading the module using loadChildren method and it will be understood by the IDEs(VSCode and
            WebStorm), webpack, etc. Previously, you have been written as below to lazily load the feature module. By
            mistake, if you have typo in the module name it still accepts the string and throws an error during build
            time.</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code106" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>This problem is resolved by using dynamic imports and IDEs are able to find it during compile time itself.

        <h1>93. How to use polyfills in Angular application?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The Angular CLI provides support for polyfills officially. When you create a new project with the ng new
            command, a src/polyfills.ts configuration file is created as part of your project folder. This file includes
            the mandatory and many of the optional polyfills as JavaScript import statements. Let's categorize the
            polyfills,</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Mandatory polyfills:</b>These are installed automatically when you create your project with ng new
                command and the respective import statements enabled in 'src/polyfills.ts' file.</li>
            <li><b>Optional polyfills:</b>You need to install its npm package and then create import statement in
                'src/polyfills.ts' file. For example, first you need to install below npm package for adding web
                animations (optional) polyfill. bash npm install --save web-animations-js and create import statement in
                polyfill file. javascript import 'web-animations-js'; </li>

        <p><b>Sanitization</b> is the inspection of an untrusted value, turning it into a value that's safe to insert

        <h1>106. What is the difference between interpolated content and innerHTML?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The main difference between interpolated and innerHTML code is the behavior of code interpreted. Interpolated
            content is always escaped i.e, HTML isn't interpreted and the browser displays angle brackets in the
            element's text content. Where as in innerHTML binding, the content is interpreted i.e, the browser will
            convert < and> characters as HTMLEntities. For example, the usage in template would be as below,</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code114" language="html"></prismcode>
        <p>and the property defined in a component.</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code115" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>Even though innerHTML binding create a chance of XSS attack, Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and

        <h1>108. How do you support server side XSS protection in Angular application?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The server-side XSS protection is supported in an angular application by using a templating language that
            automatically escapes values to prevent XSS vulnerabilities on the server. But don't use a templating
            language to generate Angular templates on the server side which creates a high risk of introducing
            template-injection vulnerabilities.</p>

        <h1>109. Is angular prevents http level vulnerabilities?</h1>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>Angular has built-in support for preventing http level vulnerabilities such as as cross-site request forgery
            (CSRF or XSRF) and cross-site script inclusion (XSSI). Even though these vulnerabilities need to be
            mitigated on server-side, Angular provides helpers to make the integration easier on the client side.</p>

                <p>You can place i18n on every element tag whose fixed text is to be translated. For example, you need

                <prismcode [code]="code122" language="html"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Create a translation file: </b>
                <p>Use the Angular CLI xi18n command to extract the marked text into an industry-standard translation
                    source file. i.e, Open terminal window at the root of the app project and run the CLI command xi18n.
                </p>
                <prismcode [code]="code123" language="javascript"></prismcode>

                    copying and renaming the default messages.xlf file. You need to copy source text node and provide
                    the translation under target tag. For example, create the translation file(messages.de.xlf) for
                    German language</p>

        <p>Collection is a set of related schematics collected in an npm package. For example, @schematics/angular

    <div class="answers">
        <p>You can create your own schematic collections to integrate your library with the Angular CLI. These
            collections are classified as 3 main schematics,</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Add schematics: </b>These schematics are used to install library in an Angular workspace using ng add
                command. For example, @angular/material schematic tells the add command to install and set up Angular
                Material and theming.</li>
            <li><b>Generate schematics: </b>These schematics are used to modify projects, add configurations and
                scripts, and scaffold artifacts in library using ng generate command. For example, @angular/material
                generation schematic supplies generation schematics for the UI components. Let's say the table component
                is generated using ng generate @angular/material:table .</li>
            <li><b>Update schematics: </b>These schematics are used to update library's dependencies and adjust for
                breaking changes in a new library release using ng update command. For example, @angular/material update

        <h1>126. What is the difference between ngIf and hidden property?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The main difference is that *ngIf will remove the element from the DOM, while [hidden] actually plays with
            the CSS style by setting display:none. Generally it is expensive to add and remove stuff from the DOM for
            frequent actions.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_the_purpose_of_ngFor_trackBy">
        <h1>127. What is the purpose of ngFor trackBy?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The main purpose of using *ngFor with trackBy option is performance optimization. Normally if you use NgFor
            with large data sets, a small change to one item by removing or adding an item, can trigger a cascade of DOM
            manipulations. In this case, Angular sees only a fresh list of new object references and to replace the old
            DOM elements with all new DOM elements. You can help Angular to track which items added or removed by
            providing a trackBy function which takes the index and the current item as arguments and needs to return the
            unique identifier for this item.</p>
        <p>For example, lets set trackBy to the trackByTodos() method</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code132" language="javascript"></prismcode>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>The safe navigation operator(?)(or known as Elvis Operator) is used to guard against null and undefined
            values in property paths when you are not aware whether a path exists or not. i.e. It returns value of the
            object path if it exists, else it returns the null value.</p>
        <p>For example, you can access nested properties of a user profile easily without null reference errors as
            below,</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code134" language="html"></prismcode>
        <p>Using this safe navigation operator, Angular framework stops evaluating the expression when it hits the first

        <p>FormBuilder is a service provided by Angular's Reactive Forms module that simplifies the process of creating
            instances of FormGroup and FormControl. It provides a fluent API for dynamically constructing form groups
            and form controls, making it easier to define complex forms with nested structures.</p>
        <p>Instead of manually instantiating FormGroup and FormControl instances and adding them one by one, you can use
            FormBuilder to streamline the process. It encapsulates common form-building tasks and provides methods for
            creating form controls with predefined initial values, validators, and async validators.</p>
        <p>Here's how you can use FormBuilder to create a form:</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code185" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>In this example, FormBuilder is injected into the component's constructor. The group() method of FormBuilder
            is then used to create a FormGroup instance, with each form control defined using the FormControl method of
            FormBuilder. Validators can be provided as additional arguments to the FormControl method.</p>
        <p>Using FormBuilder helps to make the code more concise and readable, especially for complex forms with
            multiple form controls and validation requirements. It also promotes consistency and reduces the likelihood
            of errors when defining forms.</p>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>You can create a form group without using FormBuilder by directly instantiating the FormGroup class and

        <p>While using FormBuilder provides a more concise and fluent API for creating forms, directly instantiating
            FormGroup and FormControl classes gives you more control over the form creation process and may be

        <h1>168. What are the types of validator functions?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>In reactive forms, the validators can be either synchronous or asynchronous functions,</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Sync validators:</b>These are the synchronous functions which take a control instance and immediately
                return either a set of validation errors or null. Also, these functions passed as second argument while
                instantiating the form control. The main use cases are simple checks like whether a field is empty,
                whether it exceeds a maximum length etc.</li>
            <li><b>Async validators:</b>These are the asynchronous functions which take a control instance and return a
                Promise or Observable that later emits a set of validation errors or null. Also, these functions passed
                as second argument while instantiating the form control. The main use cases are complex validations like
                hitting a server to check the availability of a username or email.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The representation of these validators looks like below</p>

        <h1>169. How do you optimize the performance of async validators?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Since all validators run after every form value change, it creates a major impact on performance with async
            validators by hitting the external API on each keystroke. This situation can be avoided by delaying the form
            validity by changing the updateOn property from change (default) to submit or blur. The usage would be
            different based on form types,</p>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>The :host pseudo-class selector is used to target styles in the element that hosts the component. Since the
            host element is in a parent component's template, you can't reach the host element from inside the component
            by other means. For example, you can create a border for parent element as below,</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_ng_deep_property_in_angular">
        <h1>171. What is ng-deep property in angular?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The ng-deep attribute is a special Angular directive that is used to apply CSS styles to child components of
            a component. It is primarily used in combination with the CSS ::ng-deep combinator to pierce through
            component encapsulation and style elements inside child components.</p>
        <p>Here's how it works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Component Encapsulation:</b>By default, Angular components have view encapsulation enabled, which
                means that the styles defined in a component's CSS file only apply to the HTML template of that
                component and are not inherited by child components.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Piercing Component Encapsulation: </b>In some cases, you may need to style elements inside child
                components from a parent component. To achieve this, you can use the ng-deep attribute along with the
                ::ng-deep combinator in your CSS.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Usage: </b>
                <prismcode [code]="code191" language="css"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Applying Styles: </b>When the ng-deep attribute is used in a parent component's CSS, it disables view
                encapsulation for the styles within its scope. This allows the styles to be applied not only to the
                parent component but also to its child components and their descendants.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Caution: </b>While ng-deep can be useful for styling child components from a parent component, it
                should be used judiciously. Overuse of ng-deep can lead to tightly coupled and less maintainable code.
                Whenever possible, it's better to style components using the standard Angular encapsulation mechanisms
                or by using component inputs and outputs to pass styling information.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>It's worth noting that ng-deep is considered deprecated as of Angular 11, and its usage is discouraged in
            favor of alternative approaches such as component composition and styling using component inputs and
            outputs. However, it remains available for use in older Angular versions and may still be used in specific
            scenarios where necessary.</p>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>setValue() and patchValue() are both methods provided by Angular's Reactive Forms module for setting values
            to form controls within a FormGroup. However, they differ in how they handle setting values and their
            behavior when dealing with partial data updates.</p>
        <p>Here are the main differences between setValue() and patchValue():</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Aspect</th>

        <p>In summary, setValue() is used when you want to set values for all form controls in a FormGroup, while
            patchValue() is used when you want to selectively update values for some form controls without affecting the
            others. setValue() ensures completeness of data and triggers validation for all controls, while patchValue()
            allows for more flexibility in data updates and does not trigger validation for untouched controls.</p>
        <p> Let's delve deeper into the differences between setValue() and patchValue() with examples:</p>
        <p><b>setValue()</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Completeness:</b>setValue() requires values for all form controls in the FormGroup.</li>
            <li><b>Validation:</b>Triggers validation for all form controls in the FormGroup.</li>
            <li><b>Error Handling:</b> Throws an error if any form control is missing or extra.</li>
            <li><b>Overwriting Existing Data:</b>Overwrites existing values for all form controls.</li>
            <li><b>Example:</b>
                <prismcode [code]="code200" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>patchValue()</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Completeness:</b>Allows setting values for a subset of form controls in the FormGroup.</li>
            <li><b>Validation:</b>Does not trigger validation for untouched controls.</li>
            <li><b>Error Handling:</b>Does not throw errors if some form controls are missing.</li>
            <li><b>Overwriting Existing Data:</b>Overwrites existing values for specified form controls, leaving others

                <prismcode [code]="code201" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Example Scenario:</b></p>
        <p>Let's say you have a FormGroup representing a user profile form with 'firstName', 'lastName', and 'email'
            form controls. You want to update the user's first name and email address without affecting the last name.
            Here's how you would use setValue() and patchValue():</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code202" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>In this scenario, setValue() fails because it requires values for all form controls, including 'lastName',
            while patchValue() successfully updates only the specified form controls ('firstName' and 'email') without
            affecting the rest.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_are_the_differences_between_reset_and_clear">
        <h1>175. What are the differences between reset() and clear()?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>In the context of Angular forms, reset() and clear() are methods used to manipulate the state of form
            controls, but they serve different purposes. Here's a breakdown of their differences:</p>
        <p><b>reset()</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Functionality:</b>reset() is used to reset the form to its initial state, clearing all values and
                resetting the form control states.</li>
            <li><b>Behavior:</b>It resets the form controls to their initial values (if provided), otherwise, it resets
                them to empty values.</li>
            <li><b>Validation:</b> It resets the validation state of the form controls, marking them as pristine,
                untouched, and valid.</li>
            <li><b>Usage Example:</b>
                <prismcode [code]="code203" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>clear()</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Functionality:</b>clear() is not a built-in method in Angular forms. It's typically a custom method
                implemented by developers to clear the values of specific form controls or form groups.</li>
            <li><b>Custom Implementation:</b>Developers need to implement the logic for clearing form control values or
                resetting specific parts of the form manually.</li>
            <li><b>Flexibility:</b>It offers more flexibility in terms of what specific data you want to clear from the
                form, but it requires custom coding.</li>
            <li><b>Usage Example:</b>
                <prismcode [code]="code204" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In summary, reset() is a built-in method provided by Angular forms to reset the entire form to its initial
            state, while clear() is typically a custom method implemented by developers to clear specific form control
            values or reset specific parts of the form.</p>
