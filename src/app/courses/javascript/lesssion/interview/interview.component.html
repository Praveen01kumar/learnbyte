        <h1>1. What is javascript?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and
            dynamic behavior to web pages. Initially developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995, JavaScript has
            evolved to become one of the most widely used languages on the web.</p>
        <p>Here are some key points about JavaScript:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Client-Side Scripting: </b>JavaScript is mainly used as a client-side scripting language, meaning it
                runs on the user's web browser rather than on the web server. This allows developers to create dynamic
                web content that responds to user actions without needing to communicate with the server.</li>
            <li><b>Versatile Language: </b>JavaScript is versatile and can be used for a variety of purposes, including
                building web applications, creating interactive web pages, developing mobile apps (using frameworks like
                React Native or Ionic), building server-side applications (using Node.js), and more.</li>
            <li><b>Interactivity and Event Handling: </b>JavaScript allows developers to create interactive elements on
                web pages, such as forms, buttons, animations, and games. It provides APIs for handling user actions
                like clicks, mouse movements, keyboard input, and touch events.</li>
            <li><b>Dynamic HTML Manipulation: </b>JavaScript can manipulate the HTML and CSS of a web page in real-time.
                This means you can dynamically change the content, style, and structure of a webpage based on user
                interactions or other conditions.</li>
            <li><b>Asynchronous Programming: </b>JavaScript supports asynchronous programming, allowing tasks to be
                executed concurrently without blocking the execution of other code. This is crucial for handling
                operations like fetching data from servers, processing user input, or performing animations without
                freezing the user interface.</li>
            <li><b>Cross-Platform Compatibility: </b>JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers, including
                Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera. Additionally, with the rise of server-side JavaScript
                frameworks like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for building server-side applications, making it a
                full-stack language.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Overall, JavaScript is a powerful and flexible language that plays a vital role in modern web development,
            enabling developers to create rich, interactive web experiences.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_are_the_various_data_types_exist_in_JavaScript">
        <h1>2. What are the various data types exist in JavaScript?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>JavaScript supports several data types, which can be broadly categorized into two groups: primitive data
            types and non-primitive (or reference) data types. Here's an overview of each:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Primitive Data Types:</b>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li><b>Number:</b>Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.</li>
                    <li><b>String:</b>Represents sequences of characters enclosed within single or double quotes.</li>
                    <li><b>Boolean:</b>Represents logical values, true or false, used for decision-making.</li>
                    <li><b>Null:</b>Represents the intentional absence of any value.</li>
                    <li><b>Undefined:</b>Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.</li>
                    <li><b>Symbol:</b>Represents unique identifiers, often used as object keys.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:</b>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li><b>Object: </b>Represents a collection of key-value pairs where values can be primitive or
                        reference types. Objects are used for storing complex data structures and are the fundamental
                        building blocks of JavaScript. Example: &lbrace; name: 'John', age: 30 &rbrace;.</li>
                    <li><b>Array: </b>Represents a list-like collection of elements. Arrays can contain elements of any
                        data type, including other arrays and objects. Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].</li>
                    <li><b>Function: </b>Represents a reusable block of code that can be invoked with a set of
                        arguments. Functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript, meaning they can be assigned to
                        variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. Example: function add(a, b)
                        &lbrace; return a + b; &rbrace;.</li>
                    <li><b>Date: </b>Represents a specific point in time, typically expressed as a timestamp. Date
                        objects are used for working with dates and times. Example: new Date().</li>
                    <li><b>RegExp: </b>Represents a regular expression, used for pattern matching within strings.
                        Regular expressions provide a powerful way to search, match, and replace text. Example:
                        /pattern/.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

    <div class="questions" id="what_is_truthy_and_falsy_value">
        <h1>3. what is truthy and falsy values?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Truthy and falsy values in JavaScript refer to values that are inherently considered as either "true" or
            "false" when evaluated in a boolean context, such as in conditionals or logical operations. Understanding
            truthy and falsy values is important because it affects how JavaScript behaves when conditions are
            evaluated.</p>
        <p>Here's a brief explanation along with examples:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Truthy Values:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any value that is not explicitly false, null, undefined, 0, NaN, or an empty string ('') is
                        considered truthy.</li>
                    <li>When evaluated in a boolean context, truthy values result in true.</li>
                    <li>
                        <prismcode [code]="code" language="javascript"></prismcode>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Falsy Values:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Values that are inherently false, empty, or represent absence are considered falsy.</li>
                    <li>When evaluated in a boolean context, falsy values result in false.</li>
                    <li>
                        <prismcode [code]="code1" language="javascript"></prismcode>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Understanding truthy and falsy values is crucial when writing conditions in JavaScript. It allows for concise
            and readable code by leveraging the implicit boolean coercion of values.</p>

        <h1>4. What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>There are many ways to create objects in javascript as mentioned below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Object Literal</b>
                <p>The simplest way to create an object is by using object literal notation, which involves enclosing
                    key-value pairs within curly braces &lbrace;&rbrace;.</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code2" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Constructor Function</b>
                <p>You can create objects using constructor functions, which are regular functions used with the new
                    keyword to create instances of objects.</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code3" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Object.create()</b>
                <p>The Object.create() method allows you to create a new object with the specified prototype object and
                    optional properties.</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code4" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Object constructor:</b>
                <p>The simplest way to create an empty object is using the Object constructor. Currently this approach
                    is not recommended.</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code5" language="javascript"></prismcode>
                <p>The Object() is a built-in constructor function so "new" keyword is not required. The above code
                    snippet can be re-written as:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code6" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Function constructor with prototype:</b>
                <p>This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code7" language="javascript"></prismcode>
                <p>This is equivalent to creating an instance with Object.create method with a function prototype and
                    then calling that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code8" language="javascript"></prismcode>
                <p>OR</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Object's assign method:</b>
                <p>The Object.assign method is used to copy all the properties from one or more source objects and
                    stores them into a target object.</p>
                <p>The following code creates a new staff object by copying properties of his working company and the
                    car he owns.</p>

                <b>Class Syntax (Introduced in ECMAScript 2015)</b>
                <p>JavaScript classes provide syntactical sugar over constructor functions and prototypes. You can use
                    the class keyword to define a class and create objects using the new keyword.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_a_prototype_chain">
        <h1>5. What is a prototype chain?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>In JavaScript, every object has an internal property called [[Prototype]] (commonly referred to as the
            "prototype"), which refers to another object. This object is often called the object's prototype, and it
            forms what is known as the "prototype chain."</p>
        <p>Here's how the prototype chain works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Object Prototype</b>
                <ul style="margin-right: 20px;">
                    <li>Every JavaScript object has a prototype except for the base object itself, which is the root of
                        the prototype chain.</li>
                    <li>The base object's prototype is null.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Prototype Inheritance</b>
                <ul style="margin-right: 20px;">
                    <li>When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for that property or
                        method on the object itself.</li>
                    <li>If the property or method is not found on the object, JavaScript then looks at the object's
                        prototype (the object referenced by its [[Prototype]] property) and continues the search there.
                    </li>
                    <li>This process continues recursively until the property or method is found or until the end of the
                        prototype chain (i.e., when the [[Prototype]] property of an object is null).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Prototype Chain</b>
                <ul style="margin-right: 20px;">
                    <li>The prototype chain is essentially a series of linked objects, where each object's prototype is
                        the previous object in the chain.</li>
                    <li>By following this chain, JavaScript can implement inheritance, allowing objects to inherit
                        properties and methods from their prototype objects.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here's a simple example to illustrate the prototype chain:</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code14" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>Understanding the prototype chain is essential for understanding how inheritance works in JavaScript and how
            objects share behavior and properties.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>call, apply, and bind are methods in JavaScript that are used to manipulate the context (this keyword) of
            functions. Here's the difference between them:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>call</b>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>The call method is used to invoke a function with a specific this value and arguments provided
                        individually.</li>
                    <li>It takes the this value as the first argument, followed by any additional arguments as needed.
                    </li>

                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Similar to call, the apply method is used to invoke a function with a specific this value and
                        arguments provided as an array or an array-like object.</li>
                    <li>It takes the this value as the first argument and an array (or array-like object) containing the

                <b>bind</b>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>The bind method is used to create a new function with a specified this value and optionally
                        pre-filled arguments.</li>
                    <li>It does not immediately invoke the function but returns a new function with the specified

        </ol>
        <p>In summary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use call when you want to pass arguments individually.</li>
            <li>Use apply when you want to pass arguments as an array or array-like object.</li>
            <li>Use bind when you want to create a new function with a specified context and optionally pre-filled

    <div class="answers">
        <p>In JavaScript, this is a special keyword that refers to the object on which a method is being invoked, or in
            other words, the context in which a function is called. The value of this depends on how a function is
            called, and it is determined dynamically at runtime. Understanding this is crucial for working with
            object-oriented JavaScript and for maintaining the correct context within functions.</p>

        <h1>10. What is the purpose of the array splice method?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The splice() method in JavaScript is used to change the contents of an array by removing or replacing
            existing elements and/or adding new elements in place. Unlike the slice() method, which returns a new array
            containing a portion of the original array, splice() modifies the original array directly.</p>
        <p>Here's the syntax of the splice() method:</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code31" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <ul>
            <li>startIndex: The index at which to start changing the array.</li>
            <li>deleteCount: The number of elements to remove from the array (starting from startIndex). If set to 0, no
                elements will be removed.</li>
            <li>item1, item2, ...: Optional items to add to the array at startIndex.</li>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>The main difference between slice() and splice() in JavaScript lies in how they modify the original array:

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>slice()</b>
                <ul>

    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Object and Map are both commonly used data structures in JavaScript, but they serve different purposes and
            have different characteristics. Here's a comparison between the two:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Purpose</b>
                <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><b>Object</b>Objects are used to store key-value pairs where keys are strings (or symbols) and
                        values can be of any data type. They are used for representing structured data and are
                        fundamental in JavaScript.</li>
                    <li><b>Map</b>Maps are also used to store key-value pairs, but unlike objects, the keys in maps can
                        be of any data type, not just strings or symbols. They offer more flexibility in terms of the
                        types of keys that can be used.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Key Type</b>
                <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><b>Object</b>Keys must be strings or symbols.</li>
                    <li><b>Map</b>Keys can be of any data type, including objects, functions, and primitive values.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Order</b>
                <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><b>Object</b>The order of properties in an object is not guaranteed. Properties may be iterated
                        in the order they were added, but this behavior is not standardized.</li>
                    <li><b>Map</b>The order of key-value pairs is preserved. When iterating over a map, the order of
                        insertion is maintained.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Size</b>
                <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><b>Object</b>To get the number of properties in an object, you need to manually iterate over the
                        object or use Object.keys(obj).length, which can be inefficient for large objects.</li>
                    <li><b>Map</b>Provides a size property to directly get the number of key-value pairs in the map.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><b>Object</b> Iterating over properties of an object can be done using for...in loop or
                        Object.keys, Object.values, or Object.entries methods.</li>
                    <li><b>Map</b>Iterating over a map can be done using methods like forEach, keys, values, or entries.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Performance</b>
                <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><b>Object</b>Generally optimized for property access and manipulation. Property access is
                        usually faster compared to maps.</li>
                    <li><b>Map</b>Optimized for scenarios where keys are frequently added or removed, especially with
                        large datasets.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Memory Usage</b>
                <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><b>Object</b>May consume less memory for smaller datasets due to internal optimizations by
                        JavaScript engines.</li>
                    <li><b>Map</b>May consume more memory compared to objects, especially for larger datasets, because
                        of the additional overhead associated with each entry.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In summary, use Object when you have string or symbol keys and don't need to preserve insertion order or
            support keys of different data types. Use Map when you need more flexibility in the types of keys, need to
            preserve insertion order, or when working with large datasets where efficient addition and removal of
            key-value pairs are crucial.</p>

            value is a concatenation of the previous array.</p>
        <p>Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need
            for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and make it harder to break your application by not
            having any side effects. These principles are coming together with the Immutability concept of ES6: giving
            preference to const over let usage.</p>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>The let statement declares a block scope local variable. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are
            limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with

            <li>
                <b>Hoisting</b>
                <p>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of
                    their containing scope during the compile phase, before the code execution. However, only the
                    declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.Example:</p>

                <b>Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)</b>
                <p>TDZ is the period between entering a scope (through block or function) and the actual declaration of
                    a variable. Accessing a variable in its TDZ results in a runtime error.Example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code56" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Lexical Scope</b>
                <p>Lexical scope refers to the scope resolution of variables at the time of their definition by their
                    location within the code. This means that a variable defined outside of a function can be accessed
                    inside that function.Example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code57" language="javascript"></prismcode>

            <li>
                <b>Closure</b>
                <p>Closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its
                    surrounding state (the lexical environment). It gives you access to an outer function's scope from
                    an inner function.Example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code58" language="javascript"></prismcode>

            <li>
                <b>Variable Scope</b>
                <p>Variable scope defines the accessibility of variables in different parts of the code. In JavaScript,

            <li>
                <b>Function Scope</b>
                <p>In JavaScript, variables declared inside a function have function scope, meaning they are only
                    accessible within that function.</p>

        <p><b>Differentiation:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hoisting moves declarations to the top of their containing scope, allowing variables to be accessed
                before they are declared.</li>
            <li>Temporal Dead Zone occurs when variables are accessed before their declaration within a scope, resulting
                in a runtime error.</li>
            <li>Lexical scope refers to the accessibility of variables based on their location within the code,
                following the hierarchy of scopes.</li>
            <li>Closure allows inner functions to access variables from their outer lexical scope even after the outer
                function has finished execution.</li>
            <li>Variable scope defines where a variable can be accessed in the code, such as global scope, function

    <div class="questions" id="What_are_modules_and_Why_do_you_need_modules">
        <h1>29. What are modules and Why do you need modules?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Modules in programming languages, including JavaScript, are essentially files that contain reusable code or
            units of functionality. They help organize code into smaller, more manageable pieces, making it easier to
            maintain, reuse, and collaborate on larger projects. JavaScript modules were introduced as part of ES6
            (ECMAScript 2015) to provide a standardized way to encapsulate code and its dependencies.</p>
        <p>Here's why modules are important and why you need them:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Encapsulation</b>Modules encapsulate related code into separate units, allowing you to hide
                implementation details and expose only what's necessary. This helps reduce complexity and makes code
                easier to understand and maintain.</li>
            <li><b>Code Organization</b>Modules allow you to organize your codebase into logical units based on
                functionality, making it easier to navigate and manage larger projects. Each module can focus on a
                specific task or feature, improving code readability and maintainability.</li>
            <li><b>Reusability</b>Modules promote code reuse by allowing you to import and use functionality from one
                module into another. This reduces duplication of code and promotes a more modular and DRY (Don't Repeat
                Yourself) coding approach.</li>
            <li><b>Dependency Management</b>Modules help manage dependencies between different parts of your
                application. By explicitly specifying dependencies, modules make it easier to understand and track the
                dependencies between different components, libraries, or modules.</li>
            <li><b>Isolation</b>Modules provide a level of isolation, ensuring that variables and functions defined
                within a module do not pollute the global scope. This helps prevent naming collisions and conflicts
                between different parts of your codebase.</li>
            <li><b>Scalability</b>As your project grows, modules make it easier to scale and maintain your codebase. You
                can add new modules or refactor existing ones without impacting the rest of your application, allowing
                for more agile development and easier collaboration among team members.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Overall, modules are essential for building maintainable, scalable, and modular JavaScript applications. They
            promote best practices in code organization, encapsulation, and dependency management, leading to more
            robust and easier-to-maintain codebases.</p>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during

        <h1>33. How do you reuse information across service worker restarts?</h1>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>The problem with service worker is that it gets terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next
            needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a service worker's onfetch and onmessage handlers. In this
            case, service workers will have access to IndexedDB API in order to persist and reuse across restarts.</p>

                <b>Cache Storage</b>
                <p>Cache Storage is a storage mechanism provided by the browser that allows web developers to store and

                    improved performance. It is part of the broader Cache API, which provides programmatic access to the

                    <li>
                        <b>Usage</b>
                        <p>Cache Storage is commonly used in Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and offline-first web
                            applications to cache resources for offline use and provide a faster, more responsive user
                            experience.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here's a brief example of how Cache Storage can be used:</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code70" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>In summary, Shared Storage enables data sharing across multiple tabs or windows of the same origin, while
            Cache Storage allows developers to store and retrieve web resources for improved performance and offline
            capabilities. Both mechanisms play important roles in building modern web applications that prioritize
            real-time collaboration, performance, and offline support.</p>
        <p>These are some of the main storage options available in web browsers, each with its own properties,
            capabilities, and limitations. The choice of storage mechanism depends on factors such as the type of data
            to be stored, the required storage capacity, and the desired behavior (e.g., persistence, session-specific).

                    chaining multiple asynchronous operations.Example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code82" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Async/Await</b>
                <p>Async/Await is a syntax built on top of Promises, providing a more synchronous-looking way to write
                    asynchronous code.Example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code83" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Event Emitters</b>
                <p>Event emitters allow objects to emit named events that cause listener functions to be called when the
                    event is triggered.Example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code84" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Generators</b>
                <p>Generators are functions that can be paused and resumed, making them useful for handling asynchronous
                    code.Example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code85" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This example demonstrates fetching data from an API using different asynchronous methods: callbacks,
            promises, async/await, event emitters, and generators. Error handling is also incorporated, with error
            messages logged when data retrieval fails. Each method's output is prefixed with the method name for
            clarity.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="In_Rxjs_how_many_possible_ways_are_there_to_handle_asynchronous_operations">
        <h1>47. In Rxjs how many possible ways are there to handle asynchronous operations?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>In RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript), there are several ways to handle asynchronous operations and
            data streams. RxJS provides a powerful set of operators and patterns for working with streams of data. Here
            are some common ways to handle asynchronous operations using RxJS:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Observables</b>
                <p>Observables are a central concept in RxJS, representing a sequence of values over time. They can be
                    created from various sources such as events, arrays, promises, or even other observables.Example:
                </p>
                <prismcode [code]="code86" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Operators</b>
                <p>RxJS provides a wide range of operators that allow you to transform, filter, combine, and manipulate
                    data streams.Example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code87" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Subjects</b>
                <p>Subjects are both an observable and an observer, allowing you to multicast values to multiple
                    observers.Example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code88" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Schedulers</b>
                <p>RxJS provides schedulers to control when and how notifications are delivered, allowing you to specify
                    concurrency, time intervals, and execution contexts.Example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code89" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Error Handling</b>
                <p>RxJS provides operators like catchError, retry, and throwError to handle errors in data
                    streams.Example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code90" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are just a few examples of handling asynchronous operations using RxJS. The library offers a rich set
            of features for working with reactive programming patterns, allowing you to create complex asynchronous
            workflows in a concise and composable manner.</p>

                result * 2.</li>
            <li>After that the value passed to the next .then handler by logging the result(2) and return a promise with

        <h1>58. What is a strict mode in javascript?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict”
            operating context. This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The
            literal expression "use strict"; instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode.</p>

        <h1>59. Why do you need strict mode?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Strict mode is useful to write "secure" JavaScript by notifying "bad syntax" into real errors. For example,
            it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for
            assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing
            variable, or a non-existing object.</p>

        <p>The strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function. If declared

    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>In HTML, the &lt;script&gt; tag is used to define a client-side script, such as JavaScript. The
            &lt;script&gt; tag has several attributes that can be used to customize its behavior:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>src</b>
                <p>This attribute specifies the URL of an external script file to be imported. For example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code100" language="html"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>type</b>
                <p>This attribute specifies the MIME type of the script. It's often set to "text/javascript", but it's
                    not required anymore in HTML5. For example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code101" language="html"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>async</b>
                <p>This Boolean attribute specifies that the script should be executed asynchronously. This means that
                    the script is executed while the page continues to load, and it doesn't block other page processes.
                    For example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code102" language="html"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>defer</b>
                <p>This Boolean attribute specifies that the script execution should be deferred until after the
                    document has been parsed. This is useful when the script relies on the HTML structure of the page.
                    For example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code103" language="html"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>integrity</b>
                <p>This attribute allows a cryptographic hash of the resource to be included, to ensure that the fetched
                    file is delivered without unexpected manipulation. It's often used in combination with the src
                    attribute for ensuring the integrity of external scripts. For example:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code104" language="html"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>crossorigin</b>
                <p>This attribute is used when loading scripts from a different origin (domain). It specifies how the
                    browser should handle the loading of the script in terms of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
                    policy. It can have values like "anonymous" or "use-credentials". For example:</p>

        <h1>66. What is the difference between native, host and user objects?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Native objects are objects that are part of the JavaScript language defined by the ECMAScript specification.
            For example, String, Math, RegExp, Object, Function etc core objects defined in the ECMAScript spec. Host
            objects are objects provided by the browser or runtime environment (Node). For example, window,
            XmlHttpRequest, DOM nodes etc are considered as host objects. User objects are objects defined in the
            javascript code. For example, User objects created for profile information.</p>

            <li>It avoids callback hell which is unreadable</li>
            <li>Easy to write sequential asynchronous code with .then()</li>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>In HTML, the terms "attribute" and "property" also have distinct meanings.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Attribute</b>
                <ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
                    <li>In HTML, attributes are the additional information or characteristics provided within the start
                        tag of an element.</li>
                    <li>They define the behavior or appearance of the element.</li>
                    <li>Attributes are always represented as strings.</li>
                    <li>Example:In this &lt;a&gt; (anchor) element, href is an attribute specifying the hyperlink
                        reference.</li>

                <ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
                    <li>In HTML, properties are related to the DOM (Document Object Model) representation of elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>They are JavaScript objects representing the HTML elements and their attributes.</li>
                    <li>Properties can be accessed and manipulated through JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>Example:In this example, innerHTML is a property of the paragraph element accessed using
                        JavaScript. It allows you to get or set the HTML content of the element.</li>

        <p>In summary, in HTML, attributes are part of the markup within the HTML tags, defining initial characteristics

        <p><b>seal()</b></p>
        <p>The Object.seal() method is used to seal an object, by preventing new properties from being added to it and
            marking all existing properties as non-configurable. But values of present properties can still be changed

        <p>The freeze() method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an object does not allow adding new properties to
            an object,prevents from removing and prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_a_Set">
        <h1>123. What is a Set?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>In JavaScript, a Set is a collection of values where each value must be unique. Unlike arrays, sets do not
            allow duplicate values. The Set object lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or
            object references.</p>
        <p>Here’s an example demonstrating various operations on a Set:</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code215" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <b>Key Points:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Unique Values</b> A Set automatically ensures all values are unique.</li>
            <li><b>Add Values</b> Use the add() method to add values to a Set.</li>
            <li><b>Check for Values</b> Use the has() method to check if a value exists in the Set.</li>
            <li><b>Delete Values</b> Use the delete() method to remove a value from a Set.</li>
            <li><b>Size Property</b> Use the size property to get the number of elements in the Set.</li>
            <li><b>Iterate Over Values</b> You can iterate over the values of a Set using methods like forEach() or a
                for...of loop.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this example, the array numbers contains duplicate values. By converting it to a Set and then back to an
            array, we effectively remove the duplicates, resulting in uniqueNumbers containing only unique values.</p>
        <p>Sets in JavaScript are particularly useful when you need to maintain a collection of unique items, such as
            removing duplicates from an array or ensuring unique entries in a collection.</p>

            <li><b>Size Property:</b> Use the size property to get the number of key-value pairs in the Map.</li>
            <li><b>Iterate Over Entries:</b> You can iterate over the key-value pairs using methods like forEach(),

    <div class="answers">
        <p>The event loop is a process that continuously monitors both the call stack and the event queue and checks
            whether or not the call stack is empty. If the call stack is empty and there are pending events in the event
            queue, the event loop dequeues the event from the event queue and pushes it to the call stack. The call
            stack executes the event, and any additional events generated during the execution are added to the end of
            the event queue.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> The event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, even though JavaScript is
            single-threaded, by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible. Since most modern kernels

        <p>Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of function calls(creates execution

        <p>The event queue follows the queue data structure. It stores async callbacks to be added to the call stack. It
            is also known as the Callback Queue or Macrotask Queue.</p>
        <p>Whenever the call stack receives an async function, it is moved into the Web API. Based on the function, Web
            API executes it and awaits the result. Once it is finished, it moves the callback into the event queue (the
            callback of the promise is moved into the microtask queue).</p>
        <p>The event loop constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. Once the call stack is empty and
            there is a callback in the event queue, the event loop moves the callback into the call stack. But if there
            is a callback in the microtask queue as well, it is moved first. The microtask queue has a higher priority
            than the event queue.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>There are two ways to copy an object,</p>
        <p><b>Shallow Copy:</b> Shallow copy is a bitwise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact
            copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other
            objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.</p>
        <b>Example</b>
        <prismcode [code]="code280" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>to create a duplicate</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code281" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code282" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>The above statement will also change the name of empDetails, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're
            losing the original data as well.</p>
        <p><b>Deep copy: </b>A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to
            by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.</p>
        <b>Example</b>
        <prismcode [code]="code283" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable.</p>

        <h1>186. What are the possible ways to make deep copy?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>In JavaScript, making a deep copy of an object means creating a new object that is a complete duplicate of
            the original, including all nested objects and arrays. Here are several methods to achieve a deep copy in
            JavaScript:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Using JSON Methods</b>
                <p>One of the simplest ways to deep copy an object in JavaScript is to use JSON.stringify() and
                    JSON.parse().</p>

        <h1>187. How do you trim a string at the beginning or ending?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The trim method of string prototype is used to trim on both sides of a string. But if you want to trim
            especially at the beginning or ending of the string then you can use trimStart/trimLeft and
            trimEnd/trimRight methods. Let's see an example of these methods on a greeting message,</p>

    <div class="questions" id="Does_javascript_uses_mixins">
        <h1>188. Does javascript uses mixins?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Mixin is a generic object-oriented programming term - is a class containing methods that can be used by other
            classes without a need to inherit from it. In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. ie. There
            can be only one [[prototype]] for an object.</p>
        <p>But sometimes we require to extend more than one, to overcome this we can use Mixin which helps to copy
            methods to the prototype of another class.</p>
        <p>Say for instance, we've two classes User and CleanRoom. Suppose we need to add CleanRoom functionality to
            User, so that user can clean the room at demand. Here's where concept called mixins comes into picture.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_a_thunk_function">
        <h1>189. What is a thunk function?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. It doesn’t take any arguments but gives
            the value whenever you invoke the thunk. i.e, It is used not to execute now but it will be sometime in the
            future. Let's take a synchronous example,</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_are_asynchronous_thunks">
        <h1>190. What are asynchronous thunks?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The asynchronous thunks are useful to make network requests. Let's see an example of network requests,</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code294" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>The getData function won't be called immediately but it will be invoked only when the data is available from
            API endpoint. The setTimeout function is also used to make our code asynchronous. The best real time example
            is redux state management library which uses the asynchronous thunks to delay the actions to dispatch.</p>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>The easiest approach is using regular expressions to detect and replace newlines in the string. In this case,
            we use replace function along with string to replace with, which in our case is an empty string.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_the_difference_between_reflow_and_repaint">
        <h1>192. What is the difference between reflow and repaint?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>A repaint occurs when changes are made which affect the visibility of an element, but not its layout.
            Examples of this include outline, visibility, or background color. A reflow involves changes that affect the
            layout of a portion of the page (or the whole page). Resizing the browser window, changing the font, content
            changing (such as user typing text), using JavaScript methods involving computed styles, adding or removing
            elements from the DOM, and changing an element's classes are a few of the things that can trigger reflow.
            Reflow of an element causes the subsequent reflow of all child and ancestor elements as well as any elements
            following it in the DOM.</p>
