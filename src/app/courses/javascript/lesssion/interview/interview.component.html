        <h1>1. What is javascript?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and
            dynamic behavior to web pages. Initially developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995, JavaScript has
            evolved to become one of the most widely used languages on the web.</p>
        <p>Here are some key points about JavaScript:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Client-Side Scripting: </b>JavaScript is mainly used as a client-side scripting language, meaning it
                runs on the user's web browser rather than on the web server. This allows developers to create dynamic
                web content that responds to user actions without needing to communicate with the server.</li>
            <li><b>Versatile Language: </b>JavaScript is versatile and can be used for a variety of purposes, including
                building web applications, creating interactive web pages, developing mobile apps (using frameworks like
                React Native or Ionic), building server-side applications (using Node.js), and more.</li>
            <li><b>Interactivity and Event Handling: </b>JavaScript allows developers to create interactive elements on
                web pages, such as forms, buttons, animations, and games. It provides APIs for handling user actions
                like clicks, mouse movements, keyboard input, and touch events.</li>
            <li><b>Dynamic HTML Manipulation: </b>JavaScript can manipulate the HTML and CSS of a web page in real-time.
                This means you can dynamically change the content, style, and structure of a webpage based on user
                interactions or other conditions.</li>
            <li><b>Asynchronous Programming: </b>JavaScript supports asynchronous programming, allowing tasks to be
                executed concurrently without blocking the execution of other code. This is crucial for handling
                operations like fetching data from servers, processing user input, or performing animations without
                freezing the user interface.</li>
            <li><b>Cross-Platform Compatibility: </b>JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers, including
                Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera. Additionally, with the rise of server-side JavaScript
                frameworks like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for building server-side applications, making it a
                full-stack language.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Overall, JavaScript is a powerful and flexible language that plays a vital role in modern web development,
            enabling developers to create rich, interactive web experiences.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_are_the_various_data_types_exist_in_JavaScript">
        <h1>2. What are the various data types exist in JavaScript?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>JavaScript supports several data types, which can be broadly categorized into two groups: primitive data
            types and non-primitive (or reference) data types. Here's an overview of each:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Primitive Data Types:</b>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li><b>Number:</b>Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.</li>
                    <li><b>String:</b>Represents sequences of characters enclosed within single or double quotes.</li>
                    <li><b>Boolean:</b>Represents logical values, true or false, used for decision-making.</li>
                    <li><b>Null:</b>Represents the intentional absence of any value.</li>
                    <li><b>Undefined:</b>Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.</li>
                    <li><b>Symbol:</b>Represents unique identifiers, often used as object keys.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:</b>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li><b>Object: </b>Represents a collection of key-value pairs where values can be primitive or
                        reference types. Objects are used for storing complex data structures and are the fundamental
                        building blocks of JavaScript. Example: &lbrace; name: 'John', age: 30 &rbrace;.</li>
                    <li><b>Array: </b>Represents a list-like collection of elements. Arrays can contain elements of any
                        data type, including other arrays and objects. Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].</li>
                    <li><b>Function: </b>Represents a reusable block of code that can be invoked with a set of
                        arguments. Functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript, meaning they can be assigned to
                        variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. Example: function add(a, b)
                        &lbrace; return a + b; &rbrace;.</li>
                    <li><b>Date: </b>Represents a specific point in time, typically expressed as a timestamp. Date
                        objects are used for working with dates and times. Example: new Date().</li>
                    <li><b>RegExp: </b>Represents a regular expression, used for pattern matching within strings.
                        Regular expressions provide a powerful way to search, match, and replace text. Example:
                        /pattern/.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

    <div class="questions" id="what_is_truthy_and_falsy_value">
        <h1>3. what is truthy and falsy values?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Truthy and falsy values in JavaScript refer to values that are inherently considered as either "true" or
            "false" when evaluated in a boolean context, such as in conditionals or logical operations. Understanding
            truthy and falsy values is important because it affects how JavaScript behaves when conditions are
            evaluated.</p>
        <p>Here's a brief explanation along with examples:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Truthy Values:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any value that is not explicitly false, null, undefined, 0, NaN, or an empty string ('') is
                        considered truthy.</li>
                    <li>When evaluated in a boolean context, truthy values result in true.</li>
                    <li>
                        <prismcode [code]="code" language="javascript"></prismcode>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Falsy Values:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Values that are inherently false, empty, or represent absence are considered falsy.</li>
                    <li>When evaluated in a boolean context, falsy values result in false.</li>
                    <li>
                        <prismcode [code]="code1" language="javascript"></prismcode>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Understanding truthy and falsy values is crucial when writing conditions in JavaScript. It allows for concise
            and readable code by leveraging the implicit boolean coercion of values.</p>

        <h1>4. What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>There are many ways to create objects in javascript as mentioned below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Object Literal</b>
                <p>The simplest way to create an object is by using object literal notation, which involves enclosing
                    key-value pairs within curly braces &lbrace;&rbrace;.</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code2" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Constructor Function</b>
                <p>You can create objects using constructor functions, which are regular functions used with the new
                    keyword to create instances of objects.</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code3" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Object.create()</b>
                <p>The Object.create() method allows you to create a new object with the specified prototype object and
                    optional properties.</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code4" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Object constructor:</b>
                <p>The simplest way to create an empty object is using the Object constructor. Currently this approach
                    is not recommended.</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code5" language="javascript"></prismcode>
                <p>The Object() is a built-in constructor function so "new" keyword is not required. The above code
                    snippet can be re-written as:</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code6" language="javascript"></prismcode>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Function constructor with prototype:</b>
                <p>This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code7" language="javascript"></prismcode>
                <p>This is equivalent to creating an instance with Object.create method with a function prototype and
                    then calling that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.</p>
                <prismcode [code]="code8" language="javascript"></prismcode>
                <p>OR</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Object's assign method:</b>
                <p>The Object.assign method is used to copy all the properties from one or more source objects and
                    stores them into a target object.</p>
                <p>The following code creates a new staff object by copying properties of his working company and the
                    car he owns.</p>

                <b>Class Syntax (Introduced in ECMAScript 2015)</b>
                <p>JavaScript classes provide syntactical sugar over constructor functions and prototypes. You can use
                    the class keyword to define a class and create objects using the new keyword.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_a_prototype_chain">
        <h1>5. What is a prototype chain?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>In JavaScript, every object has an internal property called [[Prototype]] (commonly referred to as the
            "prototype"), which refers to another object. This object is often called the object's prototype, and it
            forms what is known as the "prototype chain."</p>
        <p>Here's how the prototype chain works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Object Prototype</b>
                <ul style="margin-right: 20px;">
                    <li>Every JavaScript object has a prototype except for the base object itself, which is the root of
                        the prototype chain.</li>
                    <li>The base object's prototype is null.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Prototype Inheritance</b>
                <ul style="margin-right: 20px;">
                    <li>When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for that property or
                        method on the object itself.</li>
                    <li>If the property or method is not found on the object, JavaScript then looks at the object's
                        prototype (the object referenced by its [[Prototype]] property) and continues the search there.
                    </li>
                    <li>This process continues recursively until the property or method is found or until the end of the
                        prototype chain (i.e., when the [[Prototype]] property of an object is null).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Prototype Chain</b>
                <ul style="margin-right: 20px;">
                    <li>The prototype chain is essentially a series of linked objects, where each object's prototype is
                        the previous object in the chain.</li>
                    <li>By following this chain, JavaScript can implement inheritance, allowing objects to inherit
                        properties and methods from their prototype objects.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here's a simple example to illustrate the prototype chain:</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code14" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>Understanding the prototype chain is essential for understanding how inheritance works in JavaScript and how
            objects share behavior and properties.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>call, apply, and bind are methods in JavaScript that are used to manipulate the context (this keyword) of
            functions. Here's the difference between them:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>call</b>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>The call method is used to invoke a function with a specific this value and arguments provided
                        individually.</li>
                    <li>It takes the this value as the first argument, followed by any additional arguments as needed.
                    </li>

                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Similar to call, the apply method is used to invoke a function with a specific this value and
                        arguments provided as an array or an array-like object.</li>
                    <li>It takes the this value as the first argument and an array (or array-like object) containing the

                <b>bind</b>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>The bind method is used to create a new function with a specified this value and optionally
                        pre-filled arguments.</li>
                    <li>It does not immediately invoke the function but returns a new function with the specified

        </ol>
        <p>In summary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use call when you want to pass arguments individually.</li>
            <li>Use apply when you want to pass arguments as an array or array-like object.</li>
            <li>Use bind when you want to create a new function with a specified context and optionally pre-filled

    <div class="answers">
        <p>In JavaScript, this is a special keyword that refers to the object on which a method is being invoked, or in
            other words, the context in which a function is called. The value of this depends on how a function is
            called, and it is determined dynamically at runtime. Understanding this is crucial for working with
            object-oriented JavaScript and for maintaining the correct context within functions.</p>

        <h1>10. What is the purpose of the array splice method?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The splice() method in JavaScript is used to change the contents of an array by removing or replacing
            existing elements and/or adding new elements in place. Unlike the slice() method, which returns a new array
            containing a portion of the original array, splice() modifies the original array directly.</p>
        <p>Here's the syntax of the splice() method:</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code31" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <ul>
            <li>startIndex: The index at which to start changing the array.</li>
            <li>deleteCount: The number of elements to remove from the array (starting from startIndex). If set to 0, no
                elements will be removed.</li>
            <li>item1, item2, ...: Optional items to add to the array at startIndex.</li>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>The main difference between slice() and splice() in JavaScript lies in how they modify the original array:

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>slice()</b>
                <ul>

    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>Object and Map are both commonly used data structures in JavaScript, but they serve different purposes and
            have different characteristics. Here's a comparison between the two:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Purpose</b>
                <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><b>Object</b>Objects are used to store key-value pairs where keys are strings (or symbols) and
                        values can be of any data type. They are used for representing structured data and are
                        fundamental in JavaScript.</li>
                    <li><b>Map</b>Maps are also used to store key-value pairs, but unlike objects, the keys in maps can
                        be of any data type, not just strings or symbols. They offer more flexibility in terms of the
                        types of keys that can be used.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Key Type</b>
                <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><b>Object</b>Keys must be strings or symbols.</li>
                    <li><b>Map</b>Keys can be of any data type, including objects, functions, and primitive values.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Order</b>
                <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><b>Object</b>The order of properties in an object is not guaranteed. Properties may be iterated
                        in the order they were added, but this behavior is not standardized.</li>
                    <li><b>Map</b>The order of key-value pairs is preserved. When iterating over a map, the order of
                        insertion is maintained.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Size</b>
                <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><b>Object</b>To get the number of properties in an object, you need to manually iterate over the
                        object or use Object.keys(obj).length, which can be inefficient for large objects.</li>
                    <li><b>Map</b>Provides a size property to directly get the number of key-value pairs in the map.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><b>Object</b> Iterating over properties of an object can be done using for...in loop or
                        Object.keys, Object.values, or Object.entries methods.</li>
                    <li><b>Map</b>Iterating over a map can be done using methods like forEach, keys, values, or entries.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Performance</b>
                <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><b>Object</b>Generally optimized for property access and manipulation. Property access is
                        usually faster compared to maps.</li>
                    <li><b>Map</b>Optimized for scenarios where keys are frequently added or removed, especially with
                        large datasets.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Memory Usage</b>
                <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><b>Object</b>May consume less memory for smaller datasets due to internal optimizations by
                        JavaScript engines.</li>
                    <li><b>Map</b>May consume more memory compared to objects, especially for larger datasets, because
                        of the additional overhead associated with each entry.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In summary, use Object when you have string or symbol keys and don't need to preserve insertion order or
            support keys of different data types. Use Map when you need more flexibility in the types of keys, need to
            preserve insertion order, or when working with large datasets where efficient addition and removal of
            key-value pairs are crucial.</p>

            value is a concatenation of the previous array.</p>
        <p>Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need
            for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and make it harder to break your application by not
            having any side effects. These principles are coming together with the Immutability concept of ES6: giving
            preference to const over let usage.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_the_purpose_of_the_let_keyword">
        <h1>20. What is the purpose of the let keyword?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The let statement declares a block scope local variable. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are
            limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with
            the var keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block
            scope.</p>

        <h1>22. How do you redeclare variables in a switch block without an error?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>If you try to redeclare variables in a switch block then it will cause errors because there is only one
            block. For example, the below code block throws a syntax error as below,</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code47" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>To avoid this error, you can create a nested block inside a case clause and create a new block scoped lexical
            environment.</p>

    <div class="questions" id="What_is_the_Temporal_Dead_Zone">
        <h1>23. What is the Temporal Dead Zone?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answers">
        <p>The Temporal Dead Zone(TDZ) is a specific period or area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until it
            has been intialized with a value. This behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the
            let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its
            declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError.</p>
        <p>Let's see this behavior with an example,</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code49" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>The TDZ is a safety feature introduced with let and const to catch potential bugs caused by accessing
            variables before they're initialized. It helps to enforce better coding practices and avoid unexpected
            behaviors in JavaScript programs.</p>

    <div class="answers">
        <p>IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.
            The signature of it would be as below,</p>
        <prismcode [code]="code50" language="javascript"></prismcode>
        <p>The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE
            cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you try to access variables from the IIFE then it throws an
            error as below,</p>
