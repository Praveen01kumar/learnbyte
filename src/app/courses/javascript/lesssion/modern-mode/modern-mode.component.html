    <p class="paragraph-description" id="use_strict_directive_in_JavaScript">The "use strict" directive in JavaScript enables developers to opt into a stricter mode of script execution, enforcing enhanced syntax checks and providing a more secure and optimized runtime environment. This comprehensive note delves into the nuances of the modern mode and "use strict" in JavaScript, elucidating their significance, functionality, and practical implementation through simple explanations and concise code examples.</p>
    <h2 class="content-sub-heading">1. Introduction to the Modern Mode:</h2>
    <h2 class="bullet-1">
        <ul class="dot-li">
            <li>The modern mode, also known as strict mode, is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 5 (ES5) to enhance JavaScript's security, maintainability, and performance.</li>
            <li>It introduces a set of restrictions and enhancements to the language's default behavior, mitigating common pitfalls and promoting best practices.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="bullet-1">
        <ul class="dot-li">
            <li>The "use strict" directive is a literal expression placed at the beginning of a script or a function.</li>
            <li>When enabled, it instructs the JavaScript interpreter to execute code in strict mode, adhering to a stricter set of rules and guidelines.</li>
            <li>"use strict" is backward-compatible, meaning it can be safely added to existing codebases without breaking backward compatibility.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="bullet-1">
        <ul class="dot-li">
            <li>To enable strict mode in a script, simply add the "use strict" directive at the beginning of the file.
